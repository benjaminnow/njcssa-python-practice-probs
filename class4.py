# Triangles have exactly three sides. If a triangle has three equal sides it is called an equilateral triangle.
# If a triangle has exactly two equal sides it is called an isosceles triangle.
# If a triangle has three unequal sides it is called a scalene triangle.
# The sides of a triangle must have a certain relationship to one another in order for them to form a valid triangle.
# The relationship is that the sum of any two sides must be strictly greater than the third side.
# And obviously, sides must be a whole number.

# Write a program that prompts the user to enter some integer values for the 3 sides of a triangle
# and then displays the values and the type of triangle they represent.
# If the user enters values that do not make a valid triangle, or if any values are not greater than zero,
# then the program will invalidate that triangle by saying: “This isn’t a real triangle!”

# Triangles have exactly three sides. If a triangle has three equal sides it is called 
# an equilateral triangle. If a triangle has exactly two equal sides it is called an 
# isosceles triangle. If a triangle has three unequal sides it is called a scalene triangle.
# The sides of a triangle must have a certain relationship to one another in order for 
# them to form a valid triangle. The relationship is that the sum of any two sides must 
# be strictly greater than the third side. Sides must be a whole number.

# Write a program that prompts the user to enter some integer values for the 3 sides 
# of a triangle and then displays the values and the type of triangle they represent.
# If the user enters values that do not make a valid triangle, or if any values are not 
# greater than zero, then the program will invalidate that triangle by saying: 
# “This isn’t a real triangle!”

# Write a program to solve quadratic equations (use if, else if and else).
# If there are no real solutions, just say "No Real Solutions!"
# And remember, to determine if the solutions are real, just make sure the discriminate 
# (b^2 - 4*a*c) is greater than or equal to zero. 
# useful math functions:
# math.pow - get powers of numbers - ex: math.pow(2, 2) = 4
# math.sqrt - get square root of number - ex: math.sqrt(4) = 2
